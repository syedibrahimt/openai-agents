# Smart Tutor Design Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the design requirements for building a Smart Tutor system that provides personalized, interactive learning experiences through multimodal interfaces and conversational AI.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Multimodal Interface
The system must support multiple interaction modes:
- **Voice** (real-time processing)
- **Notes** with annotations
- **Illustrations** on a whiteboard
- **Questions** with various formats:
  - Text-based questions
  - Image-based questions
  - Multiple choice questions

### 2. Question Input System
- Support for typing and uploading questions
- Text input capabilities
- Image upload and processing
- Mixed-mode question creation

### 3. Studio Mode - Step-by-Step Breakdown
- Lesson structure with sequential steps
- Multiple question structure for each step
- Granular breakdown of learning objectives
- Configurable step progression

### 4. Conversational AI with Guardrails
- **Introduction Strategy**: Build prompts that define the voice conversation flow
- **Open Conversation**: Allow students to engage in natural dialogue
- **Subject Boundaries**: Implement guardrails to prevent off-topic discussions
- **Redirection System**: Automatically guide students back to the lesson topic when they stray

### 5. Illustration Board System
The main display board must support a structured sequence:
- **Question Display**: Present the current question
- **Supporting Material**: Show relevant teaching content for each step
- **Three-Stage Illustration Flow**:
  1. **Hint #1**: Visual aid shown before asking the question
  2. **Hint #2**: Additional visual support after incorrect answers
  3. **Success Confirmation**: Visual confirmation after correct answers

### 6. Notes and Annotation System
- **Step-specific Notes**: Organized content for each learning step
- **Annotation Support**: Generic annotation framework
- **Voice Synchronization**: Align annotations with voice conversations
- **Real-time Updates**: Synchronize annotations across all interface elements

### 7. Generic Framework Architecture
- **Agentic Framework**: Design system using agent-based architecture
- **Reusability**: Ensure components can be adapted for different subjects
- **Scalability**: Build with extensibility in mind
- **Modularity**: Create interchangeable components

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Architecture Requirements
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Multimodal data handling
- Synchronization across different interface elements
- Scalable and maintainable codebase

### User Experience Goals
- Seamless interaction between voice, visual, and text elements
- Intuitive navigation through lesson steps
- Responsive feedback system
- Adaptive learning flow based on student responses

### System Boundaries
- Subject-specific guardrails
- Controlled conversation flow
- Educational objective focus
- Safe and appropriate content delivery

## Success Metrics
- Effective multimodal integration
- Smooth conversation flow with appropriate guardrails
- Synchronized display across all interface elements
- Generic framework that can be adapted for various subjects
- Consistent user experience across all interaction modes

## Future Extensibility
The system should be designed to accommodate:
- Additional question types
- New annotation formats
- Different subject domains
- Enhanced AI capabilities
- Improved visual elements
